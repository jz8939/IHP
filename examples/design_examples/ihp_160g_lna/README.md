# A 160 GHz Low Noise Amplifier with 27-GHz Bandwidth in IHP 130nm Technology

This repository contains incomplete design files and automated layout factories for a Low Noise Amplifier (LNA) originally achieving a bandwidth of 27 GHz. The amplifier can achieve a noise figure of 5.77 dB at 160 GHz, and the complete design files can be found in IHP's April 2025 Tapeout Data at [`github.com/IHP-GmbH/TO_Apr2025/160GHz_LNA`](https://github.com/IHP-GmbH/TO_Apr2025.git)
